# riscv-debug-notes
Notes and guides about debugging riscv targets

The goal of these documents is to give an introduction to the different aspects of RISC-V debugging, and to serve as a quick reference.

Each note should provide links to more complete and in depth documentation about the same topic.

* **RISC-V external debugging**: quick overview of the different components of the debug system
* **RISC-V external debug specification simplified**: the official debug specification v0.13.2 reduced to 8 pages
* **GNU Toolchain**: introduction to the GNU toolchain and short guide of GCC and GDB
* **OpenOCD for RISC-V**: introduction to OpenOCD and its configuration files
* **Building riscv-openocd**: how to build OpenOCD, especially when cross-compiling
* **Using the Diligent JTAG-HS2 Programming Cable with OpenOCD**: how to install and use this particular debug adapter
* **JTAG introduction**: quick overview of the JTAG standard and how it works

The pdfs are in the `pdfs` folder.
